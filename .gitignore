# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
nfl-rushing-api/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
nfl-rushing-api/log/*
nfl-rushing-api/tmp/*
nfl-rushing-api/log/.keep
nfl-rushing-api/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
nfl-rushing-api/tmp/pids/*
nfl-rushing-api/tmp/pids/
nfl-rushing-api/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
nfl-rushing-api/storage/*
nfl-rushing-api/storage/.keep
nfl-rushing-api.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
nfl-rushing-api/config/master.key
